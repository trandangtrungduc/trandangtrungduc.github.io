According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namiseom), Namiseom, also known as Nami Island (Korean: 남이섬), is a crescent-shaped river island situated in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, South Korea. The island was created when the surrounding land was flooded by the rising waters of the North Han River due to the construction of the Cheongpyeong Dam in 1944. The island is named after General Nami, who was falsely accused of treason and died at the age of 28 during the reign of King Sejo, the seventh monarch of the Joseon Dynasty in Korea.

There are 3 ways to get to the island: zipline, canoe and ferry. I chose the ferry to be able to enjoy the peaceful scenery as well as the fresh air here in the fall with gentle breezes.

"Winter Sonata" is a renowned movie featuring scenes shot on Nami Island. During Nami's cold yet poetic and romantic winters, visitors can observe wood stoves baking potatoes, meat, and other comforting foods. Additionally, winter activities like skiing, crafting, and encountering various animals are popular attractions on the island during this season.
