A short business trip to Melbourne in autumn provided a wonderful first experience visiting an Australian country. This place gathers many restaurants, bars and other entertainment centers.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne), Melbourne is the capital and largest city of Victoria, and it ranks as Australia’s second most populous city, following Sydney. Nowadays, Melbourne is highly culturally diverse and ranks as the world’s fourth largest city by foreign-born population.

During the day, Melbourne is gentle, refined, and comfortable, with autumn’s cool weather and sunshine creating a stunning scene. At night, the city comes alive with bustling bars and restaurants along the charming Yarra River.

It would be a waste not to enjoy the "green" scenery in Melbourne with many farms and unique animals such as Kangaroos and Koalas.
