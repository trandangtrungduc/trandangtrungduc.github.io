This is my inaugural visit to Japan, and I've selected Osaka for my solo trip. It's a bustling city at night, reminiscent of Ho Chi Minh City, offering vibrant entertainment and dining options after dark.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka), Osaka is a designated city in the Kansai region of Honshu, Japan, and is one of the three major cities in Japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya). The name "Osaka" means "large hill" or "large slope". It is uncertain when this name became more prominent than "Naniwa", but the oldest written evidence of the name dates back to 1496.

Shinsekai is a lively area featuring budget-friendly eateries, restaurants, and bars that attract tourists. Each establishment is uniquely decorated with colorful and captivating characters. It is a top destination in Osaka for nighttime entertainment, alongside Shinsaibashi and Dotonbori streets.

In contrast to the lively and bustling scenes of Shinsaibashi or Dotonbori at night, I can perceive a sense of tranquility in the morning from the images below.
