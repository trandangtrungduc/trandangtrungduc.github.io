This was my first time visiting a Chinese city in several transits here Unfortunately, it was raining all day and foggy when I arrived.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai), with approximately 24.87 million residents in 2023, the city proper ranks as the world's third most populous. And Shanghai is the largest economic center of China. Shanghai is a city that blends ancient and modern, with many famous shopping centers. Many people come to visit and enjoy the hustle and bustle of this place day and night.

Nanjing Road is one of the most famous streets in Shanghai, where many famous and oldest shopping centers, restaurants, and hotels are concentrated. Therefore, the atmosphere here is very bustling regardless of the rain.

Shanghai Bund is a famous place in ancient movies that I have seen. The rain made everything look hazy, and I think Shanghai would be an even more exciting place to explore in better weather.
