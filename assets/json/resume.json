However, they often encounter an over-segmentation problem, especially noticeable with large objects. Additionally, unreliable mask predictions stemming from superpoint mask prediction further compound this issue. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called MSTA3D. It leverages multi-scale feature representation and introduces a twin-attention mechanism to effectively capture them. Furthermore, MSTA3D integrates a box query with a box regularizer, offering a complementary spatial constraint alongside semantic queries."}],"skills":[{"name":"Soft Skill","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-person-chalkboard","keywords":["Presentation","Hard-working","Time Management","Leadership","Adaptability","Problem-solving"]},{"name":"Hard Skill","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-pencil","keywords":["Microsoft Office","Python Programming","Github, Docker, PyTorch","3D Libraries: PLY, Sponv, Open3D, Minkowski,..."]}],"languages":[{"language":"Vietnamese","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Professional working proficiency","icon":""},{"language":"Japanese","fluency":"Professional working proficiency","icon":""},{"language":"French","fluency":"Limited working proficiency","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Computer Vision","icon":"fa-solid fa-images","keywords":["Instance Segmentation","Semantic Segmentation","3D Point Cloud","Lidar"]},{"name":"Robotics","icon":"fa-solid fa-robot","keywords":["Autonomous Driving","VR/AR"]}],"projects":[{"name":"Llama for Paper Summary","url":"https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/llama-paper-summary"},{"name":"AI Dictionary for Vietnamese People","url":"https://github.com/aidic-org-ebook"},{"name":"Rule-based Chatbot Combined with ParlAI","url":"https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/ChatBot"},{"name":"Neural Network Controller for Line Follower Robot","url":"https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/ChatBot"},{"name":"Obstacle Avoiding & Grasping Robot","url":"https://https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/ObstacleAvoiding-GraspingRobot"},{"name":"Arm Robot of 3 Degree of Freedom","url":"https://https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/ArmRobot3DOF"}]}
