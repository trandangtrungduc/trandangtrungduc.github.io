This task requires accurate identification of both objects and semantic labels across spatial and temporal dimensions. In this work, we present SP2Mask4D, a novel approach that replaces the commonly used transformer architecture with a superpoint-based transformer architecture. This modification leads to faster inference and reduced memory consumption, while maintaining competitive performance compared to transformer-based methods. While both approaches use attention mechanisms, traditional transformer models apply attention to all points, resulting in high computational costs. In contrast, SP2Mask4D focuses attention within localized superpoints, significantly lowering the computational burden. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset show that SP2Mask4D reduces inference time by about 32.8% and improves memory efficiency by 60.3%, while preserving segmentation performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods."},{"name":"MSTA3D: Multi-scale Twin-Attention for 3D Instance Segmentation","publisher":"ACM Multimedia 2024","releaseDate":"2024","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3664647.3680667","summary":"Recently, transformer-based techniques incorporating superpoints have become prevalent in 3D instance segmentation. However, they often encounter an over-segmentation problem, especially noticeable with large objects. Additionally, unreliable mask predictions stemming from superpoint mask prediction further compound this issue. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called MSTA3D. It leverages multi-scale feature representation and introduces a twin-attention mechanism to effectively capture them. Furthermore, MSTA3D integrates a box query with a box regularizer, offering a complementary spatial constraint alongside semantic queries."},{"name":"Transformer-supported Tackling 3D Point Cloud Instance Segmentation","publisher":"ACVYS 2024","releaseDate":"2024","url":"https://acvys.org/proceeding-2024/","summary":"This study aims to address these challenges by utilizing the strengths of transformer models, a recent innovation in machine learning known for their ability to handle large-scale data efficiently. By reducing the number of point clouds required for training, the approach simplifies the overall model architecture and removes unnecessary intermediate steps. This not only decreases training time but also significantly reduces model complexity, making the process more streamlined and resource-efficient. Despite these reductions, the method maintains high accuracy in classifying and recognizing objects in 3D environments, ensuring robust performance even in dynamic and cluttered scenarios commonly encountered in autonomous driving. Thus, this research presents a more effective and efficient approach to 3D point cloud instance segmentation, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in AI-driven 3D object recognition."}],"skills":[{"name":"Soft Skill","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-person-chalkboard","keywords":["Presentation","Hard-working","Time Management","Leadership","Adaptability","Problem-solving"]},{"name":"Hard Skill","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-pencil","keywords":["Microsoft Office","Python Programming","Github, Docker, PyTorch","Libraries: PLY, Sponv, Open3D, Minkowski, OpenCV, PaddleOCR,...","LLMs: GPT, Gemini, Llama, Claude, Deepseek, Grok,..."]}],"languages":[{"language":"Vietnamese","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Professional working proficiency","icon":""},{"language":"Japanese","fluency":"Professional working proficiency","icon":""},{"language":"French","fluency":"Limited working proficiency","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Computer Vision","icon":"fa-solid fa-images","keywords":["Instance Segmentation","Semantic Segmentation","Panoptic Segmentation","3D/4D Point Cloud","Lidar"]},{"name":"Robotics","icon":"fa-solid fa-robot","keywords":["Autonomous Driving","VR/AR"]}],"projects":[{"name":"Multi-AI Agent for Discord","url":"https://discord.gg/s93zTmK3"},{"name":"Llama for Paper Summary","url":"https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/llama-paper-summary"},{"name":"AI Dictionary for Vietnamese People","url":"https://github.com/aidic-org-ebook"},{"name":"Rule-based Chatbot Combined with ParlAI","url":"https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/ChatBot"},{"name":"Neural Network Controller for Line Follower Robot","url":"https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/ChatBot"},{"name":"Obstacle Avoiding & Grasping Robot","url":"https://https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/ObstacleAvoiding-GraspingRobot"},{"name":"Arm Robot of 3 Degree of Freedom","url":"https://https://github.com/trandangtrungduc/ArmRobot3DOF"}]}
